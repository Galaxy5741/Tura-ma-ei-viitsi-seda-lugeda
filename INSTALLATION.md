### Step 1: Find the Extension Folder
You need to know where this extension is saved on your computer. It's the folder that contains these files:
- `manifest.json`
- `popup.html`
- `content.js`
- etc.

**Example paths:**
- Windows: `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Tura-ma-ei-viitsi-seda-lugeda`
- Mac: `/Users/YourName/Documents/Tura-ma-ei-viitsi-seda-lugeda`
- Linux: `/home/YourName/Tura-ma-ei-viitsi-seda-lugeda`

### Step 2: Open Chrome Extensions Page

**Option A - Type in address bar:**
1. Open Google Chrome
2. In the address bar at the top, type: `chrome://extensions/`
3. Press Enter

**Option B - Use menu:**
1. Open Google Chrome
2. Click the three dots ⋮ in the top-right corner
3. Hover over "Extensions"
4. Click "Manage Extensions"

2. Look at the **top-right corner**
3. Find the toggle switch that says "Developer mode"
4. **Click it to turn it ON** (it should turn blue)

### Step 4: Load Your Extension
1. You'll see new buttons appear at the top
2. Click the button that says **"Load unpacked"**
3. A file browser window will open
4. **Navigate to and SELECT the extension folder** (the one from Step 1)
   - Don't select a file - select the entire folder!
5. Click "Select Folder" or "Open"

### Step 5: Success!
You should now see your extension appear in the list! It will show:
- Name: "Quick Summarizer"
- Description: "Instantly summarize long documents with one click using AI"

### Step 6: Pin the Extension (Optional but Recommended)
1. Look for the **puzzle piece icon** 🧩 in Chrome's toolbar (top-right)
2. Click it to see all your extensions
3. Find "Quick Summarizer"
4. Click the **pin icon** 📌 next to it
