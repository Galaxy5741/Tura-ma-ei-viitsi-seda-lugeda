# Extension Icons

You need to add three icon files to this directory:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## How to Create Icons

### Option 1: Use an Online Tool
1. Visit [Favicon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) or [Icon Generator](https://tools.pdf24.org/en/create-favicon)
2. Upload an image or logo (suggestion: use a document/summary icon)
3. Generate icons in multiple sizes
4. Download and rename them to match the names above

### Option 2: Use AI to Generate
1. Ask an AI tool like DALL-E, Midjourney, or similar to create a "summary document icon"
2. Use an image editor or online tool to resize to the three required sizes
3. Save as PNG files with the names above

### Option 3: Use Simple Placeholder
For testing purposes, you can:
1. Create solid color squares in any image editor
2. Save them as 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files
3. This will work but won't look polished

## Recommended Icon Style

A good icon for this extension would include:
- A document or page symbol
- A sparkle/star to indicate AI/summarization
- Colors that match the purple/blue gradient (#667eea, #764ba2)
- Clean, simple design that's recognizable at small sizes
